# Altitude Test - Web Developers

Hi guys!

Thanks for taking an interest in me.

I used NodeJS for the backend. The node modules I used are express, cookie-parser and ejs. After you git clone this repo, you can run

```
node app.js
```

#### My Steps

1. First I sliced up the psd image on Photoshop into different parts and used the 'Save for Web' function to export the images.
2. Step 1 created a bunch of html divs. I edited the divs to give them unique ids and also edited the css so that my final design resembles the original psd design.
3. I wrote my code to manipulate the leaderboard table in script.js where I update the relevant html elements when the Poller has new results every 15 seconds.

* [style.css](public/css/style.css)
* [script.js](public/js/script.js)
